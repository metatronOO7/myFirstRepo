//Write a function that takes in an `Int`, and returns two `Int`s in a tuple.
//Using the provided array of `Int`s or your own, the function should find two numbers from the array
//that added together will equal the `Int` that you passed in, and return them.
//If no two numbers sum together to produce the number passed into the function, it should return nil.

// BEFORE YOU START
//
// Think of some cases where this function could fail!
// I can think of at least 2 off the top of my head
//
// 1.
// 2.
//
// Come up with ways to address those cases as part of
// developing your solution!


let numbers = [2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8]

print("hello world")
